    Instructions
    ============
    
    In this directory there is an Apache logfile with several entries, "puppet_access_ssl.log". In whatever language you like, as simple or as complicated as you like, write something that will print to the screen:
    
    * How many times the URL "/production/file_metadata/modules/ssh/sshd_config" was fetched
     * Of those requests, how many times the return code from Apache was not 200
    * The total number of times Apache returned any code other than 200
    * The total number of times that any IP address sent a PUT request to a path under "/dev/report/"
     * A breakdown of how many times such requests were made by IP address
    
    This solution must run & print accurate results.


Example usage:
./munge_log.sh 
/production/file_metadata/modules/ssh/sshd_config was fetched 6 times.
Of the nuber of times sshd_config was fetched, Apache returned 0 non 200 response codes.
Of all requests in the file, 6 non 200 response codes were seen.
9 PUT requests were sent to a path under /dev/report, of those the following IPs were seen:
IP 10.39.111.203 was seen 1 time(s).
IP 10.34.89.138 was seen 1 time(s).
IP 10.114.199.41 was seen 1 time(s).
IP 10.80.174.42 was seen 1 time(s).
IP 10.80.58.67 was seen 1 time(s).
IP 10.80.146.96 was seen 1 time(s).
IP 10.204.211.99 was seen 1 time(s).
IP 10.204.150.156 was seen 1 time(s).
IP 10.101.3.205 was seen 1 time(s).
